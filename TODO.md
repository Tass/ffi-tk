# Todo List

Things left to do, most of this is simple, but still a lot of code.
Items are ordered roughly by their priority.
Done items should be removed after a couple of revisions.

An item is marked as done when:
  * the code is complete.
  * specs are written for all things possible to spec.
  * the documentation has been sketched. I simply copy that part from the
    offical doc first, but since we're not clear about copyright we might have
    to use links and examples instead.

## Examples

There are a lot of examples that we can provide, both from the old Ruby bindings
and the Tk library.
They will have to be translated though, so it's still a lot of work.
Our current examples should be removed sometime, they are more or less just
proving that things run.
