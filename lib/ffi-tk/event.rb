    # Generates a window event and arranges for it to be processed just as if it
    # had come from the window system.
    # Window gives the path name of the window for which the event will be
    # generated; it may also be an identifier (such as returned by winfo id) as
    # long as it is for a window in the current application.
    # Event provides a basic description of the event, such as <Shift-Button-2>
    # or <<Paste>>.
    # If Window is empty the whole screen is meant, and coordinates are relative
    # to the screen.
    # Event may have any of the forms allowed for the sequence argument of the
    # bind command except that it must consist of a single event pattern, not a
    # sequence.
    # Option-value pairs may be used to specify additional attributes of the
    # event, such as the x and y mouse position; see EVENT FIELDS below.
    # If the -when option is not specified, the event is processed immediately:
    # all of the handlers for the event will complete before the event generate
    # command returns.
    # If the -when option is specified then it determines when the event is
    # processed.
    # Certain events, such as key events, require that the window has focus to
    # receive the event properly.
