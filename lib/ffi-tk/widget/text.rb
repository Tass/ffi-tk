    # Counts the number of relevant things between the two indices.
    # If index1 is after index2, the result will be a negative number (and this
    # holds for each of the possible options).
    # The actual items which are counted depend on the options given.
    # The result is a list of integers, one for the result of each counting option given.
    #
    # Valid counting options are :chars, :displaychars, :displayindices,
    # :displaylines, :indices, :lines, :xpixels and :ypixels.
    # The default value, if no option is specified, is :indices.
    # There is an additional possible option :update which is a modifier.
    # If given, then all subsequent options ensure that any possible out of date
    # information is recalculated.
    # This currently only has any effect for the :ypixels count (which, if
    # :update is not given, will use the text widget's current cached value for
    # each line).
    # The count options are interpreted as follows:
    #
    # :chars
    #   count all characters, whether elided or not. Do not count embedded
    #   windows or images.
    # :displaychars
    #   count all non-elided characters.
    # :displayindices
    #   count all non-elided characters, windows and images.
    # :displaylines
    #   count all display lines (i.e. counting one for each time a line wraps)
    #   from the line of the first index up to, but not including the display
    #   line of the second index. Therefore if they are both on the same display
    #   line, zero will be returned. By definition displaylines are visible and
    #   therefore this only counts portions of actual visible lines.
    # :indices
    #   count all characters and embedded windows or images (i.e. everything
    #   which counts in text-widget index space), whether they are elided or
    #   not.
    # :lines
    #   count all logical lines (irrespective of wrapping) from the line of the
    #   first index up to, but not including the line of the second index.
    #   Therefore if they are both on the same line, zero will be returned.
    #   Logical lines are counted whether they are currently visible
    #   (non-elided) or not.
    # :xpixels
    #   count the number of horizontal pixels from the first pixel of the first
    #   index to (but not including) the first pixel of the second index. To
    #   count the total desired width of the text widget (assuming wrapping is
    #   not enabled), first find the longest line and then use
    #   `text.count("#{line}.0", "#{line}.0", :xpixels)`.
    # :ypixels
    #   count the number of vertical pixels from the first pixel of the first
    #   index to (but not including) the first pixel of the second index. If
    #   both indices are on the same display line, zero will be returned. To
    #   count the total number of vertical pixels in the text widget, use
    #   `text.count('1.0', 'end', :ypixels)`, and to ensure this is up to date,
    #   use `text.count('1.0', 'end', :update, :ypixels)`.
    #
    # The command returns a positive or negative integer corresponding to the
    # number of items counted between the two indices. One such integer is
    # returned for each counting option given, so a list is returned if more
    # than one option was supplied. For example `text.count('1.3', '4.5',
    # :xpixels, :ypixels` is perfectly valid and will return a list of two
    # elements.
